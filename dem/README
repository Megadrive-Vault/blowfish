Hello Datastorm!!! 

Planet Earth is back with a brand new production!! We certainly hope you enjoy
this one, it was made with love. Some fine pixel art was drawn for this by 
ZanaGB and one fine blowfish was drawn by sigflup. All tracks are done by our
main man on the fm, the one and only, jredd. Additional help by Bonefish and 
linde. Oh yeah, and code. Can't forget that. 68000 instructions dropped on your
megadrive by sigflup. Z80 instructions by kulibus1 and sigflup.


jredd on the keyboard:
 Shout out to my fellow musicians at the 6 channel soundcloud group, and 
 anyone who has ever worked with me on a song. All those collabs made me as 
 good as I am as a solo artist, and I wouldn't be as good as I am without them. 
 Kind of like saying, this is awesome and the music is good but I owe a lot to 
 my fellow musicians for their continued support and inspiration. This one's 
 for you guys.

sigflup on the keyboard: 
 Shouts to Mask of Destiny for getting down and dirty with a logic analyser
 Shouts to Forcer for the enthusiasm
 Shouts to Chilly Willy for tolerating me on the gendev forums
 Shouts to K-Storm for being one sick dude
 Shouts to fizzer for talking to me over the emails
 Shouts to oerg886 for generally being fucking awesome

ZanaGB on the keyboard:
 Shouts to TomoAlien for introducing me to general demoscene, 
 and to Planet Earth.
